<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
At my previous company, I was the subject matter expert for a specific sales contract exhibit involving a performance guarantee. This guarantee was very technical in nature and based off of an international IEC standard. As a result, negotiations of this exhibit with customers was very technical as well and typically involved some deviations from both the IEC standard and from our company's internal guidelines. 
</p>
<p>
Negotiations of this exhibit were often left to the last minute before contract signing, but any requested deviations that came up during negotiations had to be approved by chief specialists, which involved a time-intensive back and forth process between local contractor negotiators around the world and the chief specialist team in Europe. As more and more contracts were being signed, this process became a bottle-neck for timely approval of contract negotiations. Based on discussions with the chief specialists, we decided that a risk calculator could be developed and used by local contract negotiators to analyze and approve deviations to the performance guarantee.
</p>
<h2>Performance Guarantee</h2>
<p>
The performance guarantee stated that a product under test would meet or exceed a specified threshold within a margin of uncertainty. An IEC standard was used to test the product, which specified everything from test equipment to performance calculations to methods of estimating test uncertainty. Additionally, the company had internal guidelines above and beyond the IEC standard to specify certain aspects of the test. Depending on real world constraints, customers would often request deviations from either the IEC standard or the company guidelines. 
</p>
<h2>Risk Estimate</h2>
<p>
The default contract exhibit had a standard level of risk associated with passing or failing the performance guarantee, based on historical performance test results. As failing a test could potentially involve a substantial amount of money in the form of liquidated damages, the quantification of the performance guarantee risk was considered to be an important part of the contract approval process. 
</p>
<p>
When any given contract was being negotiated, any requested deviations to the performance guarantee had to be approved by a team of chief specialists. This typically involved estimating the impact to the risk of failing the performance guarantee due to deviations from the test standard or internal guidelines.
